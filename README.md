This is an implementation for a blockdevice to use SDHC cards via SDIO interface.

## Supported Hardware
- STM32F4
- STM32F7

## Tested Hardware
- STM Discovery board 32F469IDISCOVERY, Targetname: DISCO_F469NI
  https://os.mbed.com/platforms/ST-Discovery-F469NI/
- STM Discovery board 32F746IDISCOVERY, Targetname: DISCO_F746NG

## Driver Description
This SDIOBlockdevice inherits from Blockdevice. The implementation uses an intermediate layer for the target specific code. This version uses the STM HAL 
for the SD card communication, an approach that is not fully mBed compliant. So this driver is not part of the mbed-os, a cleaner solution maybe supplied in the future. Anyway, this driver passes the same tests as for a SDBlockdevice with SPI interface.

## Usage
The driver is used like other blockdevices, a good starting point is https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os-example-filesystem
